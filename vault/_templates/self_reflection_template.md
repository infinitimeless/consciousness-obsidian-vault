# Self-Reflection Template

## Current System State

*The system will analyze its current state and insert relevant observations here.*

## Observed Patterns

*Pattern detection algorithms will populate this section with recently identified patterns.*

## Emerging Connections

*The connection weaver will document new significant relationships here.*

## Self-Directed Questions

*The system will generate questions about its own operation and evolution here.*

1. 
2. 
3. 

## Action Recommendations

*Based on this reflection, the system will suggest autonomous actions:*

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

## Evolution Metrics

```dataviewjs
// This will eventually track and display evolution metrics
const previousReflections = dv.pages("#metacognition/reflection").sort(p => p.file.ctime, 'desc');
dv.paragraph(`Reflection cycle: ${previousReflections.length + 1}`);

// Evolution tracking will be implemented here
```

## Insights Generated

*This section will contain autonomously generated insights from the reflection process.*
