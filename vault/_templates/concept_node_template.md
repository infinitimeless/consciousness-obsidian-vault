## Conceptual Connections

```dataviewjs
// This will eventually map relationships to other concepts
const connections = dv.pages().where(p => p.file.outlinks.includes(dv.current().file.link) || p.file.inlinks.includes(dv.current().file.link));
dv.paragraph(`Connected nodes: ${connections.length}`);

// Connection mapping will be implemented here
```
